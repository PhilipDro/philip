      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) allows exchange of data and functionality between software components.
          It differs from an ABI (application binary interface) in that data structures or computational routines are
          not accessed in machine code but in source code. This makes an API more hardware-independent. </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <h4>1970-1980</h4>
      <p>Communication between computers got more and more common at this time. The transport and the data handling
          development which made it easier and faster. In 1976 the Remote Procedure Call got invented.
          It is a technique for inter-process communication which is a mechanism from an operating system to allow the process
          of managing shared data. These processes often used Interface Definition Language to make the procedure payloads and
          the interactions more visible. Based on Message Oriented Middleware, which handles the passing and the queuing
          of messages, new techniques got invented through connecting legacy mainframe systems which enabled addressing
          Enterprise Application Integrations. One main system was the MQSeries from IBM. MQSeries solved a lot of the problems
          distributed computing still faced at this time. For example it assured delivery of messages without any losses. </p>
      <h4>1980-1990</h4>
      <p>In early 1990 object-oriented programming became really popular because of the concept of an organized structure
          for an application. This means splitting parts of an application into data and sets of procedures on that data
          to put them into separate objects. In this concept of structuring the API is a class combined out of context,
          behavior and identity of that object. Distributed systems spread even more through the rise and the commercializing
          of the Web 2.0 which led to new and even better techniques for object oriented programming. These techniques built
          upon the Remote Procedure Call model remotely allow the access to object instances. Open systems used Common Object
          Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and Microsoft DCOM for this procedures although both are based on Interface
          Definition Languages to get  an interface contract between server and client. The results were independent transport
          and data handling issues. The problem with this solution was that a similar middleware infrastructure was needed. </p>
      <h4>1990-current</h4>
      <p>Around 2000 most developers took advantage of the capabilities of HTTP and mark-ups like HTML, XML had to offer
          for defining RPC calls. A counter current was transforming which tried a different approach to the existing
          architectural style. The concept was a service-oriented direction and is named SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture).
          Service-Oriented means service based development and the thinking of the services outcome.
          Roy Fielding described the representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style in his dissertation.
          He had also participated in the evolution of the world wide web and the Hyper Text Protocol also known as
          HTTP which is still standard in version 1.1 today. The concept of resources and the access of information was
          the original intent of the internet and the Tim Berners Lee defined the importance of the semantic web as we know it today. </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>A good API enables the developer to put together the provided building blocks in order to achieve the desired functionality.
          Usage for the programmer is facilitated by a clear documentation. By design an API should enable modular programming
          by hiding complex details of the underlying architecture and only expose the necessary tools for the user. Likewise it is
          expected to provide a high level of abstraction to be independent from the underlying technology, the protocols or the data. </p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>While the divisions can be fluid one can differentiate APIs into three basic types. </p>
      <p>
        APIs can provide an interface to
        communicate between an <strong>operating system</strong> and an application. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) for example
        specifies a set of common APIs to maintain compatibility between different operating systems.
      </p>
      <p> Remote resources such
        as databases can be modified using a <strong>remote API</strong>. Specific protocols allow interaction between different technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Web APIs</strong> allow the client side of an application to communicate with a third-party service using HTTP to retrieve
        functions and data. In web development this concept is used to create mashups by using multiple APIs to achieve the
        desired application capability without the need to develop common functionality from scratch. This article will mainly
        focus on Web APIs as their popularity is rapidly gaining relevance with the API economy growing.
      </p>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>Recently the web and the cloud have significantly changed the circumstances and requirements for APIs. Today APIs need
          to be able to communicate with clients regardless of the underlying architecture. </p>
      <h4>SOAP</h4>
      <p>Originally APIs have been used by applications using the SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol). Clients were able
          to access methods of a server-side object transferring complex XML data using HTTP. The advantage of this protocol
          lies in its independence from programming languages and the platform used. Despite its advantages the SOAP still
          has significant weaknesses. The XML messages mostly consist of meta data thus rendering the exchange of data inefficient.
          Also assembling and disassembling them is expensive. Moreover with major tech enterprises developing their own SOAP standards
          the increasing complexity became problematic. Those disadvantages gave rise to the REST model. </p>
      <h4>REST</h4>
      <p>The REpresentational State Transfer is an architecture providing interoperability between computer systems on the internet.
          Information is returned in JSON or XML format simplifying further processing. Applications based on the REST architecture are
          commonly realized using HTTP/S. Correspondingly HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE will specify the type of the
          performed operation. Services are invoked through URL/URI. </p>

      <p>The REST architecture is based on six constraints:</p>
      <h4>Client-Server</h4>
      <p>A server offers capabilities and listens for requests. A client sends a request invoking a certain capability.
          The server then proceeds to either reject the request or perform the requested task before sending a response message back to the client.
          This is to enforce separation of concerns and make the two sides independent from each other also aiding in scalability. </p>
      <h4>Stateless</h4>
      <p>The communication between client and server has to be stateless. Every request by the client needs to contain all information
          required by the server. Following that principle improves visibility and reliability of the information exchange. </p>
      <h4>Caching</h4>
      <p>Every request is passed through a cache component which evaluates if previous responses could be reused to improve performance.
          Response messages need to be labeled either as cacheable or non-cacheable. </p>
      <h4>Uniform Contract</h4>
      <p>To frame information into a standardized format RESTful components use a single shared technical interface. This way the data does
          not have to conform to specific application architectures. </p>
      <h4>Layered System</h4>
      <p>A RESTful application is supposed to be hierarchically structured in a layered system where no layer can see past the next.
          Intermediaries which act as load balancers can improve scalability. Due to the restricted communication between layers latencies will occur. </p>
      <h4>Code-On-Demand</h4>
      <p>If server-side logic can be executed by the client more efficiently then a RESTful application can optionally utilize the principle of code-on-demand.
          This allows the client to update capabilities independently from the server. </p>
      <h3>There is an API for it!</h3>
      <p>Many applications we know already have API’s. Instagram, Google Maps, Facebook you name it. Developers can use them to create something
          completely new from given data to lending an application the last but final feature. The possibilities seem endless.
          If you look for a specific feature or data you most likely will find an API for it. This brings so many possibilities
          for every application in the building process. </p>
      <h3>Benefits of owning an API</h3>
      <p>API’s are of course something technical but there is a commercial side to it as well. Every company has its assets, you just have to find it.
          As a business, giving an API free for usages can help developing your product faster and can grow your business immensely.
          When a company is deciding of owning an API there are a few things to consider before taking this step. First of all you
          always have to think of who your customers are and what API they might find useful. The API needs to be easy to use even
          without a good documentation although a good documentation is key of saving a lot of time and money. </p>
      <h3>Benefits of using an API</h3>
      <p>API’s make things a lot easy when it comes to collecting data or have  specific functions for your application.
          They enable apps to interact with each other and can enhance the user experience if done correctly.
          A good API can spare you a lot of time as a developer. API’s get more and more popular and a lot of businesses
          start running API’s for every problem you might run into while building your application. In a lot of cases they
          can even make your app more popular or fasten certain processes your users have to go through for instance the
          facebook API for logging in with your application. </p>
      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p>The situation so far around API’s is, that it is a still growing and changing one. More and more companies decide to get involved
          in the market that has emerged and the ones that already have API’s start building more and more around them. Big businesses
          hire entire teams just to keep the documentation in sync with the API. There are still some problems when it comes to
          maintaining and using an API. For two machines to talk to each other we still need human beings to keep the API synced,
          to watch after the versioning, to have an eye on the scaling and at least to discover the API and its documentations.
          For that we need to hire more and more people to write more and more code. Which first sounds like a good solution because
          it creates more jobs in the industry but when we take a closer look, it creates more room for mistakes. Once an API got
          discovered we still need to figure out what it does, what we can use it for and how to use it. When we take this a step
          further and ask the question how do we solve the problem of human resource in the process of using and maintaining an API.
          Autonomous API’s. As Zdenek, also known as Z, published in his article about the future of API’s that the next step could be
          eliminating the human role when it comes to machine talking. </p>

      <p>He describes the workflow as following:</p>

      <p> The machine has to expose its interface together with its vocabulary. This service then has to register in an API
          discovery service to make sure it will be discovered by other machines. Later another program could search for that
          service through the used vocabulary which needs to be standardized within the discovery service.
          Of course we are still far from true machine to machine talking and some people are happy about it because the
          human variable in this has some benefits as well. We humans can think creatively and are emotion driven
          creatures and although it sometimes feels like a disadvantage it is our greatest asset. </p>
